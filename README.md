# Flow Field
 Visualisation of 3D flow fields using Python. Intention of the project is for the user to enter a desired set of equations and for the flows to be visualised in 3D.
 
 Inspired heavily by [this project](anvaka.github.io/fieldplay) which visualises the phase portrait of 2D systems. I enjoy using this tool and wanted to extend it to work with 3D flow.
 
 Future Work includes:
  - VisPy implementation which allows for user interactivity and use of GPU to visualise large amounts of data.
  - User input for equations through a GUI
  - Allow for equations to be entered using SymPy for symbolic mathematics.
